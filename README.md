### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

Hey, I'm **Lucid.H3X** — a 39-year-old furry nerd on a mission to become a cybersecurity professional!
I've always been fascinated by cybersecurity — the threats, the detectives who hunt them, and the thrill of protecting people and assets. What started as childhood dreams has become a genuine passion for information security.

**My current focus:** Threat intelligence, cloud security, malware analysis, and how AI will reshape cybersecurity's future. I'm committed to staying ahead of threat actors while contributing meaningfully to security-focused organizations.

For me, it's simple: cybersecurity keeps my childhood wonder alive. Every emerging threat, every new technique, every chance to dive deeper into this wild realm? *Chef's kiss.* That's what gets me out of bed! or keeps me hiding under the sheets for 6 weeks scared to look at a phone screen.

* 🛡️ **Defending:** Cloud environments and home labs.
* 🔍 **Hunting:** Curious about APTs , weird malware behavior and AI
* 🛠️ **Building:** Flipper Zero mods, Pi-based honeypots. RF research and breaking things on the internet.
