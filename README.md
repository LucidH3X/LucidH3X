### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

Hey, I'm Lucid.H3X — a 39-year-old furry nerd! I've always been fascinated by cybersecurity — the threats, the detectives who hunt them, and the thrill of protecting people and assets. What started as childhood dreams has become a genuine passion for information security.

**My current focus:** Threat intelligence, cloud security, malware analysis, and how AI will reshape cybersecurity's future. I'm committed to staying ahead of threat actors while contributing meaningfully to security-focused organizations.

* 🛡️ **Defending:** Cloud environments and home labs.
* 🔍 **Hunting:** Curious about APTs , weird malware behavior and AI
* 🛠️ **Building:** Flipper Zero mods, Pi-based honeypots. RF research and breaking things on the internet.
