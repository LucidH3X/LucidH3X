<h2 align="center">🕷 About Me 🕷</h2>
I recently started my journey into Offsec at the end of 2021. I was gifted a old 2012 Macbook pro and a rough Idea of the direction I wanted end up in. Its been close to year alot things have changed but the plan is now in focus and moving foward. 

- Im currently working on my Network + once that is done Ill be doing Security + and moving on to a list of other certs. Check out my 365 days of hacking repo to see my study plan and follow along with my adventure.

More details to come! 🧟‍♂️
