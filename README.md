### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About Me

Hi I am Lucid.H3X a 37 year old Security Analyst | Threat Hunter | Malware Researcher | With a Passion for research and learning.

I have always been fascinated by cybersecurity, the idea of threats, and the ability to identify and mitigate them. Who wouldn't want to be a futuristic detective when you were a kid? I dreamed of one day having the chance to work with people and do my part to secure assets and help protect people themselves from threats. As I got older, this fascination became a passion for information security and all its connected realms. My current focus in studies is threat intelligence and cloud security, alongside malware and learning the role AI will play in the future of cybersecurity. 

I challenge myself to stay a step ahead of threat actors while being an active contributor to the organizations in our ever-changing technical landscape. I love cybersecurity, as much as learning and trying to stay relevant with the threats and techniques that may be emerging. For me, the opportunity to dive into and gain insight into the wide realm of information security keeps my childlike passion and dreams alive.
