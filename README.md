### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

Hey, I'm **Lucid.H3X** — a 38-year-old furry nerd on a mission to become a cybersecurity professional! 🦊🔐

I've always been fascinated by cybersecurity — the threats, the detectives who hunt them, and the thrill of protecting people and assets. What started as childhood dreams has become a genuine passion for information security.

**My current focus:** Threat intelligence, cloud security, malware analysis, and how AI will reshape cybersecurity's future. I'm committed to staying ahead of threat actors while contributing meaningfully to security-focused organizations.

For me, it's simple: cybersecurity keeps my childhood wonder alive. Every emerging threat, every new technique, every chance to dive deeper into this wild realm? *Chef's kiss.* That's what gets me out of bed! or keeps me hiding under the sheets for 6 weeks scared to look at a phone screen.

## 🎯 My Journey

**Goal:** Employed in cybersecurity by **April 2027** in the Bay Area  
**Current Phase:** Building foundations → Steps phase (Oct 2025)  
**Target Timeline:** Security+ exam ready by Nov 7, 2026 (40th birthday!)

I'm on an 18-month sprint from Service writer / DoorDash driver → cybersecurity professional. Every commit, every challenge solved, every project built gets me closer. This is my third serious attempt, and this time? I'm going the distance.
